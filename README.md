# predict-using-unsupervised-ML
we use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters by calculating the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different numbers of clusters. We plot the elbow curve to visualize the WCSS values and determine the optimal number of clusters based on the elbow point.
